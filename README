This is my answer to the shopify back-end question:

I did this in javascript using NodeJS and ExpressJS as the back end. 
use:
1. clone/download project, run node app.js in the project directory
2. goto http://www.localhost:9999/
3. from there you can see the list inventory, use the input field and buttons.
4. you can add something to inventort. remove it with check boxes, and update it, as well as export
  the current inventory items to CSV File.
